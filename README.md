## Current TV Landscape
According to data obtained from Q2 2022, streaming services now dominate the TV viewing share in the United States at a whopping 34.8% of the market, beating out cable TV at 34.4% and broadcast TV at 21.6%. Once dominated by original paid streaming service giants like Netflix and Hulu, the streaming service landscape has become more competitive with the rise of new TV streaming services making a splash with it's own unique and original content. This saturation of the streaming service market as well as a crack down on the security of sharing passwords (Netflix May 2023) will force households to reevaluate streaming service subscriptions to minimize the money paid for subscriptions while maximizing desired content.
